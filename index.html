        <p class="one-second">She had been an angel for coming up on 10 years
            and in all that time nobody had told her this
            was possible. The fact that it could ever happen
            never even entered her mind. Yet there she stood,
            with the undeniable evidence sitting on the ground
            before her. Angels could lose their wings.</p>

        <h1 class="two-first">Some random information</h1>
        <p>
            She's asked the question so many times that she barely
            listened to the answers anymore. The answers were always
            the same. Well, not exactly the same, but the same in a
            general sense. A more accurate description was the answers
            never surprised her. So, she asked for the 10,000th time,
            "What's your favorite animal?" But this time was different.
            When she heard the young boy's answer, she wondered if she
            had heard him correctly.

        <div class="center">This is an inspiring quote or a testimonial from a customer.
            Maybe it's just filling space, or maybe people will actually read it. Who knows?
            All i know is that it looks nice.
